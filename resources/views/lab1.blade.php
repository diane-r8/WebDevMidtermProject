                            In Lab 1: Laravel Project Setup, I began by familiarizing myself with the key directories and files that form the backbone of a Laravel project. I explored how each directory serves a crucial role in the applicationâ€™s structure. For example, the <code>app/</code> directory contains the core logic, including models and controllers, while the <code>config/</code> directory stores configuration files like database settings. Understanding these folders helped me grasp how Laravel organizes its code and where to place specific components of the application.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Next, I moved on to creating the project. Using Composer, I installed Laravel, initializing the project from scratch. Once the project was set up, I created a Git repository to manage version control, which allowed me to track changes and collaborate more effectively.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I then configured the <code>.env</code> file, which is used to store environment-specific details like database credentials. I connected my Laravel application to the database by adjusting the configuration to ensure the application could interact with the database.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Following this, I worked on building the necessary views. I created several Blade templates such as <code>home.blade.php</code>, <code>about.blade.php</code>, <code>shop.blade.php</code>, and a layout file <code>layout.blade.php</code>. The layout file provided a consistent structure for all pages, which helped in keeping the design uniform. Each of these views rendered content dynamically, showcasing the power of Blade templating in Laravel.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            After setting up the views, I defined routes in the <code>web.php</code> file to map URLs to their respective views. These routes allowed me to navigate between different pages in the browser. I successfully rendered the home, about, and shop pages by visiting specific URLs in the browser, confirming that everything was set up correctly.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            By the end of Lab 1, I had a working Laravel project with multiple views, a connected database, and a structured directory system. This laid a strong foundation for building more advanced features in future labs.
